# BulkSave
BulkSave is a web app I developed to help a group of persons save each other's whatsapp contact or regular contact, in a much easier way.

# What difference does BulkSave Make:
BulkSave is a unique progressive web app that solves a problem that almost everyone encounters when it comes to networking and making new connection.
Before now, if you are in the midst of a group of potention friends, and you All want to exchange contacts, so you can keep in touch with them, you would have to pass around your phone around and this applies to everyone of you who intend to keep in touch. 
This can take mintes and hours to get all the contacts you intend to. Now what if you do not have the time to start passing your phone around? You might have to leave without getting these contacts.
BulkSave solves this problem. With BulkSave, you and even other one hundred persons or more, can easilysave each other's contacts very easily. It is easy as simply filling in your name and phone number in an input field, and downloading all contacts at ones into your Google contact and they'll be ready to view on everyone on WhatsApp within the minute.

# Languages used
On the frontend, I used Vanilla JS, HTML AND CSS, and on the backend, I used Django(Python). I chose to use Django because of how easily is makes documentation and collection of data to be.
